<title>OpenShift 3.1.1 base image</title>

<xmp style="display:none;">
## Description

This image provides a base instance of OpenShift 3.1.1, including the
master and node components, examples, GUI and web browser.  Internet
connectivity is required to run.

This image is vanilla, so is handy for SAs and consultants to replicate issues
/ experiment with the product with Internet connectivity.

By default this image requires 2 CPU(s) and 4096MB RAM.
