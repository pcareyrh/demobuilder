  This image provides a base instance of OpenShift 3.2, including the
  master and node components, examples, GUI and web browser.  Internet
  connectivity is required to run.

  This image is vanilla, so is handy for SAs and consultants to replicate issues
  / experiment with the product with Internet connectivity.
