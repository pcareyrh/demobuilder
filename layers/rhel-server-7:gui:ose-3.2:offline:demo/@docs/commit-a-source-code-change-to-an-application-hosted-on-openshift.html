## Commit a source code change to an application hosted on OpenShift

These steps demonstrate how a developer could make changes to their application
source code and quickly see those changes replicated in their own application
instance running on OpenShift.

1. Make a small change to the source code.
   1. Double-click the *Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 9.0.0.GA* icon on the
      desktop.
   1. Click the X on the *JBoss Central* tab to close the tab.
   1. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + R` to open the Open Resource window, and type
      `home.html` to select
      *monster/src/main/webapp/resources/templates/desktop/home.html*.  Click
      *Open*.
   1. Make a sample change to the text which is visible on the Ticket Monster
      home page, then click *File/Save*.
1. Commit and push the source code.
   1. Note: `CTRL + #` is an Eclipse shortcut for the following step.
   1. Right-click *&gt; monster [monster master]* in the *Project* window and
      select *Team/Commit...*.
   1. Enter a git commit message (e.g. "minor change"), ensure
      *src/main/webapp/resources/templates/desktop/home.html* is ticked, then
      click *Commit and Push*.
   1. A message should be shown including the text "Triggering OSE3 build...".
      Click *OK*.
1. See the change in the application.
   1. Return to Firefox.  OpenShift will clone, built and deploy a new version
      of the Ticket Monster application.  It will be a faster process than the
      previous build.
   1. `CTRL`-click the application URL (*http://monster-demo.apps.example.com*),
      and the change you made should soon be visible running on OpenShift.
