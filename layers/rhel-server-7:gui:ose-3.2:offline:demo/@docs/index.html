<title>OpenShift 3.1.1 offline image with demo</title>

<xmp style="display:none;">
## Description

This image provides an all-in-one instance of OpenShift 3.1.1, including the
master and node components, examples, GUI and web browser.  All S2I builder
images are also included, and source code and dependencies for all examples
apps is pre-downloaded, so no nothing extra is needed and the image can be
run disconnected from the internet.  This image also includes all the
components necessary for an OpenShift 3.1.1 demo.

This image is heavily modified and additionally includes JBoss Developer
Studio.  It is intended for SAs in order to demo the full OpenShift end-user
experience.

By default this image requires 2 CPU(s) and 8192MB RAM.

Run the VM and open the GUI.  Log in as *demo* and set your password.
