## Create an application hosted on OpenShift from a pre-defined template

These steps demonstrate how OpenShift can build and deploy a (possibly
multi-component) traditional or modern application from a pre-defined template.
This might be done by a developer, tester or operator to quickly set up a
dedicated application instance according to its template, using OpenShift's
self-service portal.

1. **IMPORTANT**: in the *Projects* list, select the *demo* project.  You must
   use the *demo* project at this point for the rest of the walk-through to
   proceed!
1. Click the *Add to Project* button.
1. Type `monster` in the *Filter by keyword* box.
1. Under *Instant Apps*, click *monster*.
1. Scroll down and click *Create*.
1. Click *Continue to overview*.
1. Wait for the example application to be cloned, built and deployed.  It will
   take up to a minute or two for the build process to begin automatically and
   then complete.
1. Optional: to follow the build, click *View Log*.  Later, click *Overview* to
   return to the overview pane.  Alternatively use the command `oc logs --follow
   build/monster-1` in a terminal to follow the build process.
1. When the monster deployment shows as running, `CTRL`-click the application
   URL (*http://monster-demo.apps.example.com*) to launch the application in a
   new tab.
