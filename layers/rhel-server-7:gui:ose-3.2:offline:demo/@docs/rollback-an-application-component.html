## Rollback an application component

These steps demonstrate how a developer could rollback an unwanted
change to an application component running on OpenShift.

1. In Firefox, click *Browse*, then *Deployments*, then *monster*.
1. Scroll down, and you should see two deployments: *#2 (latest)* and *#1*.
   Click *#1*.
1. Click the small *Roll Back* button.
1. Tick the *deployment trigger* option on.
1. Click the small *Roll Back* button again.
1. A message should appear indicating that *Deployment #3 is rolling back
   monster to monster-1*.
1. Click *Overview* to return to the overview pane.  Deployment #3 of the
   monster pod should be shown.
1. Navigate to the application front page, and press `CTRL + SHIFT + R` to
   refresh it.  In due course you should find that the change you made earlier
   has been reverted.

Note: deployment rollbacks can also be achieved using the command `oc rollback`,
e.g. `oc rollback monster-1`.
