## Debug an application hosted on OpenShift

These steps demonstrate how a developer could debug the source code of an
application running on OpenShift from their IDE.

1. Set a breakpoint.
   1. Return to JBoss Developer Studio.
   1. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + R` to open the Open Resource window, and type
      `BookingService.java` to select
      *monster/src/main/java/org/jboss/examples/ticketmonster/rest/BookingService.java*.
      Click *Open*.
   1. Press `CTRL + L`, enter `124` and click `OK`, or just scroll down to line
      124, (`public Response createBooking...`).
   1. Right-click in the grey bar to the left of the text and select *Toggle
      Breakpoint* to set a breakpoint on the function.
1. Connect to the application debugger port.
   1. Click the *OpenShift Explorer* tab in the bottom right pane.
   1. Expand the *demo* connection.
   1. The *Sign in to OpenShift* window will appear.  Enter your password and
      click *Finish*.
   1. Expand to find the pod hosting the Ticket Monster application.  This will
      be under *demo* / *Pods*, will have a name of the form
      `monster-[1-9]-[a-z0-9]{5}` and will be in state `Running`.
   1. Right-click the pod and select *Port Forwarding...*.  The *Port
      forwarding* window should show a list of ports including *debug* (*8787*).
      Click *Start All*.
   1. Click *OK*.

   Note: port forwarding can also be achieved using the command `oc
   port-forward`, e.g. `oc port-forward $POD 8787`.
1. Start debugging.
   1. Return to JBoss Developer Studio.
   1. Click *Run/Debug Configurations...*.
   1. Double-click *Remote Java Application* in the list on the left.
   1. Change the *Port* number on the right from `8000` to `8787` and click
      *Debug*.
1. Trigger the breakpoint.
   1. Return to Firefox and the Ticket Monster application.
   1. Use the application to buy a ticket.
   1. When you click *Checkout*, the breakpoint will be triggered.  You will be
      taken back to JBoss Developer Studio, and it will ask to open the Debug
      perspective.  Click *Yes*.
1. Examine the state of the application.
   1. In the *Variables* window at the top right of the screen, you will be able
      to see details of the booking you just entered.
   1. Expand the variable *bookingRequest* and right-click *email*.  Select
      *Change Value...* to change the application state in OpenShift.
   1. Enter a different, but valid, value in the box, and click *OK*.
   1. Click *Run/Resume* to resume flow of the application.
   1. Return to Firefox and click *Bookings*.  You should see that you
      successfully modified the e-mail address of your booking through the
      debugger.

   Note: there is currently a known bug in Ticket Monster whereby if the REST
   call triggering the debugger takes too long to return, a second REST call
   is erroneously issued by the browser.  This manifests in the breakpoint
   being hit twice and two bookings being made.  If this occurs, note that this
   is a bug in Ticket Monster, not in OpenShift!  To see the modified e-mail
   address in Ticket Monster, click the *Bookings* tab.
1. Return to the the *JBoss* perspective in JBoss Developer Studio.  Find the
   monster pod in the *OpenShift Explorer* pane, right-click the pod and select
   *Port Forwarding...*, click *Stop All* and click *OK*.
