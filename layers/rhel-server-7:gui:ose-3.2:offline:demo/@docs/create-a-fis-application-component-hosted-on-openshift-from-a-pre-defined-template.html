## Create a FIS application component hosted on OpenShift from a pre-defined
   template

These steps demonstrate how OpenShift can build and deploy a simple Fuse
Integration Services-based application component from a pre-defined template.
This might be done by a developer, tester or operator to quickly set up a
dedicated application comonent instance according to its template, using
OpenShift's self-service portal.

1. **IMPORTANT**: in the *Projects* list, select the *xpaas* project.  You must
   use the *xpaas* project at this point for the rest of the walk-through to
   proceed!
1. Click the *Add to Project* button.
1. Type `s2i-quickstart-cdi-camel-http` in the *Filter by keyword* box.
1. Under *Instant Apps*, click *s2i-quickstart-cdi-camel-http*.
1. Scroll down and click *Create*.
1. Click *Continue to overview*.
1. Wait for the example application to be cloned, built and deployed.  It will
   take up to a minute or two for the build process to begin automatically and
   then complete.
1. Optional: to follow the build, click *View Log*.  Later, click *Overview* to
   return to the overview pane.  Alternatively use the command `oc logs --follow
   build/s2i-quickstart-cdi-camel-http-1` to follow the build process.
