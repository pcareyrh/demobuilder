## Promote and rollback an application component without rebuild

These steps demonstrate how an operator could promote an application component
into a subsequent environment (e.g. production) for deployment/upgrade without
rebuilding the component, as well as rolling back an unwanted change if
necessary.

1. Prepare the *prod* project to host the application component.
   1. In Firefox, select the *prod* project.
   1. Click the *Add to Project* button.
   1. Type `monster-prod` in the *Filter by keyword* box.
   1. Under *Instant Apps*, click *monster-prod*.
   1. Scroll down and click *Create*.
   1. Click *Continue to overview*.
1. Tag the the oldest version of the application component in order to deploy it
   into the *prod* project.
   1. Double-click the Terminal icon on the desktop.
   1. Type `oc describe imagestream monster` and press `ENTER`.
   1. Choose the oldest of the built docker images (it'll look like
      *monster@sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}*).  Call this $TAG.  Ignore the leading
      `172.30.x.y:5000/demo/` text.
   1. Type `oc tag $TAG monster:prod` and press `ENTER`.
   1. Return to Firefox and wait for OpenShift to deploy the application into
      the prod project.  Note that the application manifest has been set to
      deploy three application pods: after successfully deploying the first pod,
      OpenShift will scale it up to three pods.
   1. `CTRL`-click the application URL
      (*http://monster-prod.apps.example.com*) to launch the application in a
      new tab.
1. Repeat the process with a newer version of the application component.
   Watch the Firefox window to see OpenShift automatically carrying out rolling
   upgrade of the application component in the *prod* project.
1. Return to the terminal window and type `exit` and press `ENTER` to close the
   window.
