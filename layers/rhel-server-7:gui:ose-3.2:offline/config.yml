description: |
  This image provides an offline instance of OpenShift 3.2, including the
  master and node components, examples, GUI and web browser.  All S2I builder
  images are also included, and source code and dependencies for all examples
  apps is pre-downloaded, so no nothing extra is needed and the image can be
  run disconnected from the internet.

  This image is fairly modified to enable offline usage.  It is intended for SAs
  and consultants to replicate issues / experiment with the product with no
  Internet connectivity, or for SAs to demo the vanilla out-of-the-box product
  with no Internet connectivity.
